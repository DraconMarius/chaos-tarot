## Description

Always interested in Tarot, but never able to brute force memorize what they all mean? Whanting some general advice that the card means for you? Since Tarot is all about symbolism as well, what about some AI generated Cards to compliment the reading?!

Chaos-Tarot / ChatGPT Tarot is here for your entertainment. Started from an ios shortcut that I had built by chucking tarot data in a dictionary and ask it to choose one so I can save it someplace using note taking app (I was using Bear, an ios markdown app). 

This MERN Application utilizes the OpenAI API endpoints along with MaterialUI, Apollo graphQL Server, and MongoDB to create an AI generated reading and image and store it in a database.
